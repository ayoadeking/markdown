## LAMP STACK PROJECT

L= Linux Operating System
A= Apache ~ Web Server
M= MySQL ~ Database Server
P= PHP ~ Programming Language

A **lamp stack** is used for backend or server-side development.A backend application is software that runs in an environment thatâ€™s hidden from end users.Backend applications consist of the following:
. Data processing Software
. Database Components
. Business Logic in code
. API for communicating with other applications.

**Static Webpages**: Information from the web server is the same for all users.For example, The address on a company website is a static content.Web developers create a static webpage with HTML and CSS programming Languages and store them as a files in the web server application.

**Dynamic Webpages** : Contain information that changes on the user viewing the webpage or web application.For example, a website that changes based on your location is dynamic content.the web server delivers dynamic websites by processing business logic or retrieving data from a database.

*Linux* - Open source

## STEP BY STEP GUIDE CREATING LAMP STACK

* STEP 1.  Launch an EC2 Instance: Start by launching an EC2 instance.
Choose an appropriate instance type and ensure it's running a Linux-based OS, such as Ubuntu.

* STEP 2. Install Apache: Once the instance is up and running, connect to it via SSH and install the Apache web server using the package manager (e.g., apt for Ubuntu).
* STEP 3. Install MySQL: Install MySQL or MariaDB for your database needs. Again, you can use the package manager to install it.

* STEP 4. Install PHP: Install PHP to complete the LAMP stack. Ensure you install the required PHP modules for your application.
* STEP 5. Configure Apache: Configure Apache to serve your web content. This involves setting up virtual hosts, configuring permissions, and other necessary settings.
* STEP 6. Configure MySQL: Set up MySQL by creating databases, users, and configuring permissions as needed for your application.

* STEP 7. Test your Setup: Once everything is configured, test your setup to ensure Apache, MySQL, and PHP are all working correctly together.


* STEP 8. Security: Ensure you follow security best practices by configuring firewalls, setting up SSH keys for secure access, and securing your database.

1. Monitoring and Scaling: Set up monitoring to keep an eye on your server's performance and consider implementing scaling solutions like AWS Auto Scaling to handle fluctuations in traffic.
2. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement backup and disaster recovery plans to ensure your data is safe in case of any unexpected events.
